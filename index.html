            <h3>Why don't we use RSA anymore</h3>
            <p>
                The main reason that RSA is no longer used as the main form of cybersecurity is becuase we have better encryption 
                algoithms that use much smaller numbers for the example above you use RSA-3 or the number of digits in the primes used is 3.
                Today for the minimum security we use RSA-617 or prime numbers that are 617 digits long.
            </p>
            <p>
                A secondary reason though would be that a quantum computer can be created that would so efficently run Shor's algorithm making the 
                requirements for RSA so insane that no non-quantum computer would ever be able to encode and decode messages. If we keep using the RSA-n
                notation then to defend against a quantum computer you would need RSA-10,000+ to defend(for a bit) against what could one day be a small quantum computer.
            </p>
            <p>Here is a problem that can stop a quantum computer.</p>

            <h3>What is happening?</h3>
            <p>
                This is a form of encryption that is able to protect against quantum computers and is able to be preformed on traditional computers.
                This is an example of using the cloest vector problem to encrypt data heres how it works at a high level.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Each person has a good and bad set of vectors that make a lattice. <br>The good and bad sets both make the same lattice, but the bad set makes traversing it way harder</li>
                <li>Your message is then converted into a number representation. I am using pairs of charcters converted to ASCII</li>
                <li>That representation has a bit of noise added to it.</li>
                <li>The noisy representation is then put onto the lattice of the intended recipient as a single point.</li>
                <li>The recipient then uses their good vectors to find the point on their lattice that is closest to that noisy point</li>
                <li>Reverse the string to integer operation to get the message. This step can involve error correction as messages are not always perfectly preserved</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                In this simple CVP based encryption scheme you use the good basis as the private key so only the recipient knows what it is but the sender can make
                and put a point on the lattice formed by the good basis becuase there is a bad basis that still makes the same lattice.
                This means that everyone knows the bad basis and can try and use it to solve the problem and in 2 dimensions it is not a 
                huge challenge. Now think about this in 3 dimensions, it gets a bit more complex. Now lets multiply that by 100 and you get 
                the small end of the range of dimensions that cryptographers are using.
            </p>
            <h3>Why is this safe against quantum computers?</h3>
            <p>
                Quantum computers are able to solve RSA encryption so fast with the use of Shor's algorithm, which utilizes a quantum
                computers ability to, in very simple terms, test a large range of x values at once. With encryption 
                schemes that are based on CVP there is no algoithm that exists for classic computers or quantum computers that can 
                solve it in polynomial time.
            </p>
            <h3>What does this look like in application?</h3>
            <p>
                There are no encryption shcemes that look like the demo above becuase there are no encryption shemes that use the CVP directly.
                This does not mean that the CVP does not come into play. An example would be Learning with Errors a common encryption shceme
                that creates a noisy linear equation as the public key this public key is build from a vector that is the private key. This becomes
                an instance of the CVP when you attempt to get the private key from the noisy linear equation.
