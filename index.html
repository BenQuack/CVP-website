            <h3>Why don't we use RSA anymore</h3>
            <p>
                The main reason that RSA is no longer used as the main form of cybersecurity is because we have better encryption 
                algorithms that use much smaller numbers. For the example above, you use RSA-3, meaning the number of digits in the primes used is 3.
                Today, for minimum security, we use RSA-617, or prime numbers that are 617 digits long.
            </p>
            <p>
                A secondary reason, though, is that a quantum computer could be created that would efficiently run Shor's algorithm, making the 
                requirements for RSA so extreme that no non-quantum computer would ever be able to encode and decode messages. If we keep using the RSA-n
                notation, then to defend against a quantum computer, you would need RSA-10,000+ to defend (for a bit) against what could one day be a small quantum computer.

            <p>Here is a problem that can stop a quantum computer.</p>

            <h3>What is happening?</h3>
            <p>
                This is a form of encryption that is able to protect against quantum computers and can be performed on traditional computers.
                This is an example of using the closest vector problem to encrypt data. Here's how it works at a high level:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Each person has a good and bad set of vectors that form a lattice. <br>The good and bad sets both form the same lattice, but the bad set makes traversing it much harder.</li>
                <li>Your message is then converted into a numerical representation. I am using pairs of characters converted to ASCII.</li>
                <li>That representation has a bit of noise added to it.</li>
                <li>The noisy representation is then placed onto the lattice of the intended recipient as a single point.</li>
                <li>The recipient then uses their good vectors to find the point on their lattice that is closest to that noisy point.</li>
                <li>Reverse the string-to-integer operation to retrieve the message. This step can involve error correction as messages are not always perfectly preserved.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                In this simple CVP-based encryption scheme, you use the good basis as the private key, so only the recipient knows what it is. However, the sender can still place a point on the lattice formed by the good basis because there is a bad basis that forms the same lattice.
                This means that everyone knows the bad basis and can try to use it to solve the problem, and in two dimensions, it is not a huge challenge. Now think about this in three dimensions — it gets a bit more complex. Now multiply that by 100, and you get 
                the lower end of the range of dimensions that cryptographers are using.
            </p>
            <h3>Why is this safe against quantum computers?</h3>
            <p>
                Quantum computers are able to solve RSA encryption very quickly using Shor's algorithm, which utilizes a quantum
                computer's ability to, in very simple terms, test a large range of x-values at once. 
                With encryption schemes based on CVP, there is no algorithm that exists — for classical computers or quantum computers — that can 
                solve it in polynomial time.
            </p>
            <h3>What does this look like in application?</h3>
            <p>
                There are no encryption schemes that look like the demo above because there are no encryption schemes that use the CVP directly.
                This does not mean that the CVP does not come into play. An example would be Learning with Errors, a common encryption scheme
                that creates a noisy linear equation as the public key. This public key is built from a vector that is the private key. 
                This becomes an instance of the CVP when you attempt to retrieve the private key from the noisy linear equation.
